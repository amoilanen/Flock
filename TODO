- Implement simple end-to-end scenario when an empty flock with no participants can be created, fixed url is created - DONE
- Use LESS - DONE
- Use Gulp to build the app - DONE

- Organizer can specify the details of a new flock, this flock is accessible via a fixed url
  -- Scenario: root of the app has been opened, then a new event is created, then navigation to the Event tab
     --- New button creates a new event, stores it, the URL is constructed using its id, then the application navigates to /configuration/{admin_id} - DONE
     --- The event details are displayed on the Event tab - DONE
     --- The created event can be accessed via this URL /admin/event/{admin_id} - DONE
     --- The created event can be accessed via this URL /guest/event/{attend_id} - DONE
     --- Event details can be edited and saved by an admin
     --- Event details can only be viewed and not edited by a guest
     --- It is possible to switch between tabs - DONE
         ---- When switching between tabs the values on the Events tab disappear
     --- Add form validation for the Event tab

     --- If non-existing eventId then empty Event tab with an error message is displayed
     --- If non-existing eventId then empty Participants tab with an error message is displayed
     --- Organizer can switch to the Participants tab which is empty
     --- Accessing /admin/* with a guest id is not possible
     --- Accessing /admin/* with unknown id is not possible
     --- Accessing /guest/* with an admin id is not possible
     --- Accessing /guest/* with unknown id is not possible
     --- Guest does not receive adminKey

- Participant can join only once using the same browser
- Organizer can 'lock' a flock so that nobody can leave or join the event after that
