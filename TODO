- Implement simple end-to-end scenario when an empty flock with no participants can be created, fixed url is created - DONE
- Use LESS - DONE
- Use Gulp to build the app - DONE

- Organizer can specify the details of a new flock, this flock is accessible via a fixed url
  -- Scenario: root of the app has been opened, then a new event is created, then navigation to the Event tab
     --- New button creates a new event, stores it, the URL is constructed using its id, then the application navigates to /configuration/{admin_id}
     --- The event details are displayed on the Event tab
     --- The created event can be accessed via this URL /configuration/{admin_id}
     --- The created event can be accessed via this URL /configuration/{attend_id}
     --- If non-existing eventId then empty Event tab with an error message is displayed
     --- If non-existing eventId then empty Participants tab with an error message is displayed
     --- Organizer can switch to the Participants tab which is empty

- Add unit testing infrastructure and add tests for the implemented scenarios, add tests for id generator
- Participants tab contents is rendered, all the participants are shown

- Support tablet resolution (iPad)
- Support phone resolution (iPhone)

- Limit on the number of the participants registered: 50 persons
- It is possible to add a new participant
- It is possible to remove a participant
- Participants can be sorted
- Participant list can be exported as text
- Participant list can be exported as pdf
- Flock can be shared with prospective participants, 'non-admin' url is generated and copied to the clipboard
- Participant who received a 'non-admin' url can join an event and will be shown in the list of participants
- Organizer can join their own flock
- Participant can leave an event they joined
- Participant can join only once using the same browser
- Organizer can 'lock' a flock so that nobody can leave or join the event after that
- Organizer can always unlock an event, even the past one

- Minification and creating a production build
- Deploy the first version to Heroku

- Flock can be shared via Facebook, Twitter, e-mail, LinkedIn, create an advanced dialog for Sharing
- Users can join flocks using their Facebook identities
- Users can join flocks using their Twitter identities
- Users can join flocks using their LinkedIn identities

- Deploy the second version to Heroku
- Localization: Finnish, Dutch, German
